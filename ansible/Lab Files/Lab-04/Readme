Lab 4 - Configuring NTP on Routers and Setting Up a Ubuntu NTP Server
This lab covers the critical task of time synchronisation in network environments. You'll configure NTP on all routers for consistent timekeeping and set up a dedicated Ubuntu server as a central NTP source, ensuring accurate logs and time-based security protocols across your lab.

Video Description:
In this lab, we expand our automation setup to include both network devices and servers, configuring NTP for accurate time synchronisation across your network. This is a practical real-world scenario where you'll set up a Ubuntu NTP server and automate the configuration of NTP on your Cisco routers.

ðŸ”§ What youâ€™ll do in this lab:

Add an Ubuntu server to your Ansible inventory

Configure the server as an NTP server using Chrony

Allow NTP traffic through the serverâ€™s firewall

Configure NTP settings on all Cisco routers

Verify your NTP configuration with show ntp associations and show ntp status
