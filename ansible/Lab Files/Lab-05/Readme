Welcome to Lab 5 of the Ansible for Network Engineers series!

In this lab, we expand our Ansible skills by adding a Juniper router to our network and exploring the use of loops and with statements to manage configuration across mixed-vendor environments. This lab is perfect for engineers looking to automate both Cisco and Juniper devices using best practices for Ansible configuration.

🔧 What you’ll do in this lab:

Update your Ansible hosts file for multi-vendor support

Use group variable files to streamline your inventory

Write a single playbook to push NTP configurations to both Cisco IOS and Juniper Junos

Use loops to apply multiple NTP servers in a single playbook

Validate NTP settings on both platforms using show ntp commands
