Lab 2 - Adding Interface Descriptions and MGMT Static Routing
In this lab, you'll expand your network automation skills by adding descriptive names to physical interfaces and configuring management static routes. This practical exercise builds on the basics of Ansible to streamline network documentation and routing, ensuring devices are correctly identified and reachable in your lab environment.

Video Description:
In this lab, we expand our Ansible setup by adding more Cisco routers to our inventory and performing live automation tasks in a Cisco lab running on EVE-NG.

ðŸ”§ What youâ€™ll do in this lab:

Manually update the Ansible hosts inventory with new devices

Use ansible all -m ping to verify SSH reachability

Create a playbook to run show ip route and identify routing issues

Spot missing static routes on two routers from the output

Write a second playbook to push static routes to all routers

Re-verify the routing table to confirm successful deployment
