# EVE-NG Topologies

This folder includes `.unl` files, startup configurations, and lab documentation for EVE-NG environments used in my blog posts, YouTube videos, and CCNP/CCIE workbook labs.

Topologies are designed for:
- CCIE SP core routing labs
- Segment Routing demos
- pyATS and Ansible testbeds

Each lab includes a visual topology image, config files, and usage notes.
