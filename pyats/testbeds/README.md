# pyATS Testbed Files

These testbed YAML files define device inventory and connectivity for pyATS scripts.

Each file includes:
- Management IP addresses
- Connection protocols
- Platform OS types
- Credential groups (if needed)

These are referenced automatically by the `--testbed` flag when running scripts.
